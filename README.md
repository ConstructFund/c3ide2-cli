# c3IDE2 Command Line Interface

## Usage

The CLI has an interactive mode, running the command will guide you through the creation of one of the addon-templates [plugin / behaviors / effects /theme ]

``` bash
c3ide2-cli-win.exe
```

you can also run the command with all the argument, to bypass the interactive mode

``` bash
c3ide2-cli-win.exe --type plugin --name my_plugin --author random_dude
```
